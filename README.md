# CherenkovDeconvolution.jl

Deconvolution problems arise when the probability density function of a quantity is estimated even though this quantity cannot be measured directly. In this scenario, the density has to be inferred from related quantities which are measured instead.

Please read [the documentation](https://mirkobunse.github.io/CriticalDifferenceDiagrams.jl/dev) and [visit our website](https://sfb876.tu-dortmund.de/deconvolution).
You can install this package with the Julia package manager (Julia-0.7 and above):

```julia
] add CherenkovDeconvolution
