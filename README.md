# Python binding for [CherenkovDeconvolution.jl](https://github.com/mirkobunse/CherenkovDeconvolution.jl)

Deconvolution problems arise when the probability density function of a quantity is estimated even though this quantity cannot be measured directly. In this scenario, the density has to be inferred from related quantities which are measured instead.

Please read [the documentation](https://mirkobunse.github.io/CherenkovDeconvolution.jl/dev) and [visit our website](https://sfb876.tu-dortmund.de/deconvolution).
You can install this Python binding via pip:

```
pip install https://github.com/mirkobunse/CherenkovDeconvolution.jl/archive/py.tar.gz
```
